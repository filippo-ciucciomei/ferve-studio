# 🌸 Ferve Studio Website


![Screenshot of feature](assets/readme-files/all-devices-black.png)



A modern and responsive website created for **Ferve Studio**, a florestry and set-design studio based in Hackney, East London (UK).  
The site acts as a **digital window display**, showcasing the studio’s aesthetic, services, and creative identity.  
Since every project is made-to-order and custom to each client, the website focuses on visual presentation rather than selling predefined items. Users can explore the studio's work and reach out through the built-in contact form.
