# 🌸 Ferve Studio Website

A modern and responsive website created for **Ferve Studio**, a forestry and set-design studio.  
The site acts as a **digital window display**, showcasing the studio’s aesthetic, services, and creative identity.  
Since every project is custom and made-to-order, the website focuses on visual presentation rather than selling predefined items. Users can explore the studio's work and reach out through the built-in contact form.
